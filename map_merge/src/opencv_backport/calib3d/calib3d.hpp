between 0.95 and 0.99 is usually good enough. Values too close to 1 can slow down the estimation
significantly. Values lower than 0.8-0.9 can result in an incorrectly estimated transformation.
@param refineIters Maximum number of iterations of refining algorithm (Levenberg-Marquardt).
Passing 0 will disable refining, so the output matrix will be output of robust method.

@return Output 2D affine transformation matrix \f$2 \times 3\f$ or empty matrix if transformation
could not be estimated.

The function estimates an optimal 2D affine transformation between two 2D point sets using the
selected robust algorithm.

The computed transformation is then refined further (using only inliers) with the
Levenberg-Marquardt method to reduce the re-projection error even more.

@note
The RANSAC method can handle practically any ratio of outliers but need a threshold to
distinguish inliers from outliers. The method LMeDS does not need any threshold but it works
correctly only when there are more than 50% of inliers.

@return Output 2D affine transformation (4 degrees of freedom) matrix \f$2 \times 3\f$ or
empty matrix if transformation could not be estimated.

The function estimates an optimal 2D affine transformation with 4 degrees of freedom limited to
combinations of translation, rotation, and uniform scaling. Uses the selected algorithm for robust
estimation.

The computed transformation is then refined further (using only inliers) with the
Levenberg-Marquardt method to reduce the re-projection error even more.

Estimated transformation matrix is:
\f[ \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta)s & -\sin(\theta)s & tx \\
                \sin(\theta)s & \cos(\theta)s & ty
\end{bmatrix} \f]
Where \f$ \theta \f$ is the rotation angle, \f$ s \f$ the scaling factor and \f$ tx, ty \f$ are
translations in \f$ x, y \f$ axes respectively.

@note
The RANSAC method can handle practically any ratio of outliers but need a threshold to
distinguish inliers from outliers. The method LMeDS does not need any threshold but it works
correctly only when there are more than 50% of inliers.
